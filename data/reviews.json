    "text": "hi! I’m a freshly licensed esthetician. I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I know one of the big drawbacks is the inability to build up a clientele because I will mainly be seeing tourists, but at this stage in my life I’m not worried about re-building loyal clients.

    "text": "Hi all! I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Hi! I started a new job a few weeks ago. I’m in the process of learning the product line and I wanted to see if any one else has worked with Eminence Organics Skin Care before and if they could give me some insight. \n\n1. I took the Level 1 training not too long ago. The esthetician teaching the training kept mentioning the double bind studies that Eminence has done and that the products have proven results. At the end of the training, I asked if there’s anywhere I can read these studies (I am a total science nerd and love learning plus I’m super skeptical about the products I use and promote). The training said no there isn’t anywhere I can view or read these studies, so I pretty much just had to take her word for it. Does anyone know anything about Eminence and if there are even any legitimate research done? \n\n2. A lot of my clients come in with hormonal acne. I was taught that if a client has an underlying condition (PCOS, medication, etc.) there isn’t much that a topical treatment will do for the hormonal acne. During the Eminence training, we were told that the Eight Greens line had phytoestrogens in it and these helped the estrogen receptors in the skin become more reactive, thus preventing/reducing hormonal acne. I was always taught that phytoestrogens do little if anything because to have an effect on the body, the client would need so much it would be u reasonable and because of the body’s acid base buffer system, the body has a pretty effective way to distinguish phytoestrogens vs. estrogens. If anyone has different knowledge about this I’d love to learn, but so far to me it just seems like smoke and mirrors. \n\nAll said and done, I just don’t want to promote products that I can’t stand behind. Any and all advice and knowledge is appreciated! Thank you! \n\n",

    "title": "Contemplating my career as an esthetician",
    "text": "I have been an esthetician for almost 3 years now, so I'm still relatively new. I love this industry, when I first learned that an esthetician exists I couldn't imagine doing anything else. Before I knew about the career I thought of becoming a dermatologist, but soon after I took the esthetician route, despite the salary difference. I always knew I wanted to make a lot of money, but for the right reasons\n\nI have been employed at 2 spas, and before that I got into a handful of pretty sketchy positions that I soon had to get out of. I was at my first real job for a little over a year at a day spa, and it had its pros &amp; cons of course - for example I was a 1099 employee so I of course had to take out all my own taxes, &amp; all the other cons of being a 1099 employee, and the owner was really shady &amp; would take a lot of \"business costs\" money out of our checks. So I had to work 6 days sometimes 7 days a week to earn enough. But the main thing was I grew so quickly. I maxed out how much I could make on retail commission because I sold so much, we would actually run out more often than the owner could replenish product, and the owner couldn't afford any more raises for me there. I also only made commission with no hourly pay when it came to services, &amp; the max I could make was 50%. (Which are all really good problems to have lol and I'm really grateful for my work ethic) I built a really good clientele &amp; I really made a name for myself, but I'm a pretty driven person &amp; I'm always reaching higher.\n\nMy long term goal as an esthetician was always to work in a med spa, and to do that I needed a year of experience which I got at that day spa. So I'm now at a med spa. I'm definitely making much less than I was, because I'm hourly ($16) but I'm definitely in a much better situation and not getting money stolen from me and a lot of other sketchy things that would go on at the day spa, so honestly peace of mind is more worth it to me than to work there again. It's just so slow here. I have had probably literally 10 clients in total in the 2 months ive been here between 2 locations, and it doesn't make sense because they have good marketing, beautiful place, and the doctor that over sees the practice is really great and even has been featured in Forbes. There are 4 locations in the state I'm in, and I'm working at 2 of them that are near me. Most days I sit in the treatment room for hours doing nothing (which I know a lot of estheticians have been through unfortunately) I try to do a lot of continued education, social media/marketing and make the most of my time but it gets hard. I am grateful I am at least being paid regardless, but the downtime has made me reflect a lot.\n\nWith all the little cons like this of being an esthetician, including how rare it has been for me to come across any spa that offers any kind of benefits like insurance, PTO, or even just guaranteed income at the bare minimum, for the longest time it has been worth it to me &amp; the love I have for the job outweighed the cons but I'm starting to think more long term. Realistically I can't really live off $16 an hour for long, even though I budget every cent I earn &amp; am very strict with myself- I never spend more than I earn. I originally wanted to open my own spa and start out solo, but the risk is just so high. I feel like I thought my purpose was always to open a spa and eventually employ estheticians &amp; give them the opportunity to work at a great spa and have a good job that pays well and has good benefits, but as I gain more experience &amp; that time to do that gets closer it's incredibly daunting. I know you miss 100% of the chances you don't take, but sometimes I think what if I just ended up going the dermatologist route. I would be making business owner money &amp; live the type of life I strive for, while making a really big difference in my community, without the business owner risk &amp; stress. I know being a derm will of course have its own cons like anything else, &amp; its an incredibly hard path and competitive, (and the student loans) but it's been really heavy on my mind.\n\nI always wanted to be in the medical side of esthetics, like I am now, I love giving clients results they're looking for while also being able to do facial massage (which is one of my biggest strengths &amp; things I love about esthetics) and make it a relaxing environment, &amp; I think I'd really miss that if I was to be a dermatologist.\n\nI just turned 21 so time is definitely on my side, but not for much longer. If I were to become a dermatologist I'd like to be one by at least my early 30s. But I don't know whatt I'd do if I realized it wasn't right for me. I also couldn't see myself doing injections/botox. I want to shadow some derms soon but I wanted to get some insight from some estheticians in this community. If you made it this far then thanks so much for hearing me out &amp; taking the time to read.",

    "text": "I’ve had my solo business for a little over a year. I’m pretty slow still overall, but I’m slowly getting more clientele. My auntie who is pretty close to me came in for her first service a couple of months ago. She gets a medical treatment I don’t offer at a big med spa in town. Anyways, she booked a service w me for a couple of weeks from now. I saw her today at a birthday party and she said “what is your price for the service? I only ask because I went to get my treatment at the medspa, and they charge x amount for the same service that I get with you. I of course wanna keep getting that service, but I’d obviously go with the cheaper option”\n\nMy prices are in fact quite a bit cheaper, and she’s close family so I would be willing to even price match if I was more expensive, but man that stung. I’m not in her pockets, but just for context she is very well off financially, which just adds an extra layer. Although I know, this economy can be hard on everyone. \n\nI dk what I’m looking for. Encouragement I guess? How to not take it personally or feel offended? Am I overreacting and overthinking this?\n\nSometimes I feel like my business is seen as just a little hobby by those close to me, but I’m trying so hard to make my dreams come true with this. Stuff like this just kinda kicks me down a bit. I want to be taken seriously. ",

    "text": "I work at a Medical Spa. It's only ever offered tox, weight loss injections, and all the other things nurse Injectors do. I was the 1st esthetician she hired. The owner wanted me to come in and establish this place as a skin care place and do esthetician services. The majority of clientelle is brow waxing, at my previous job I was almost fully booked with brows. \n\nI knew not everyone would follow me to the new spa and I knew not all my brow clients would want to turn into facial clients. And I know it takes a few years to get clientele. I'm doing about 15 to 20 clients week here.(however it's slowing a bit since off season is coming) however most of them are brow services. I've been here about 9 months now. And I'm slowly starting to get a few facials a week. \n\nEverything was fine here but she talked to me one day. And said she is cutting my hours in half because she is paying me too much hourly and my services aren't expensive enough. (She does pay a very good hourly) And she said she expected me to be doing mostly Microneedling, High level chemical peels and more expensive services like that. Keep in mind our facial prices are the most expensive in my entire town.\n\n She also thinks an hour is way too long for a full facial. She said taking an hour for a facial is not enough profit. She also is only letting me work 3 days a week. And I'm not allowed to come in early, stay late, or come in on Saturdays. She also keeps giving me attitude and mildly excluding me on the daily. She also says when we do facials we need to start upcharging for things like Extractions, or facial massage, and massaging their shoulder while masks set, and things like that. I politely said we charge the most in town and no one else \nUp charges for those things usually they are included. She didn't agree\n\nSocial media is also a problem. I post daily and post on my Instagram story 8 to 10 times a day. Because that is what our marketing girl wants us to do. I'm always either not posting enough or what I post isn't good enough. I'm not getting any clients from social media. And  the owner never talks up my services to her clients even though she has full books of tox and filler clients. They don't even know I do this here.\n\nI also don't have a lot of products to use for facials. Like for example I have 1 mask I can use for facials. I could go on for hours about all the things like that happening. I feel like she wants me to quit so she can hire someone at a lower pay than she offered me. Some of my current clients are telling me they are struggling to get in with me with my schedule being like this. So my number of services are going down. So I'm scared of she's going to end up firing me.\n\n I've been calling and emailing and going into every esthetician business in town and none of them are hiring at the moment.So part of me is considering leaving but idk what other career I'd want. Or if I'm ready to go back to school for something else. But I'm getting anxious at work so bad. I can't tell if I'm the problem and being dramatic. But I've lost all my confidence in my work because of this job. But I'd miss my clients. I'm not sure what to do or if I'm the problem. I'm tired of feeling like everything I do is wrong. And I don't feel safe enough to talk to her about my concerns and I'm scared of getting fired. Any comforting word would be appreciated too if you don't have advice. \n",

    "text": "i am posting this to warn other esthies. there is a corporate company opening franchises all across the country. im not talking like one location per city, im talking minimum of 3 locations per city. san diego will be getting 12. the job listing will have a different name than the company, but when you read the job description it will have the company name that starts with an S. if you google it, it is a med spa that does hormones, weight loss, recovery, and aesthetic services. it started in Florida.\n\ni was the “medical” aesthetician at the first franchised location in a big city in the southeast. the most basic service offered that i could do was a Hydrafacial. you will also do microneedling with SkinPen (PRP will be additional), CoolSculpting Elite, CoolTone, and chemical peels. now, the services are awesome. i loved doing them. but the company sets the business up to fail. the CEO literally does not care HOW the business is doing, just that more centers are opening. my center opened in november, and we have been through 3 managers (one who didnt even work a day-literally got back from training in florida and quit the next morning), 3 different marketing groups, and countless empty days. the center is failing and is tremendously in the hole, and the CEO literally does not care and wants to go ahead and open the next center in our city. \n\nit is going to seem like your dream job on paper. higher HOURLY pay, commission, insurance, PTO and paid sick days, all of that, but none of it is real. i left officially on saturday. i never saw a cent of my commission. i barely got PTO.  i was out with the flu (tested and all), and did not get my paid sick days. they cut my hours from full time to part time without telling me. i never got insurance. \n\nat first, i was leaving because i’m moving to be with my parents (because i cant afford to live on my own anymore because of this job). i asked someone in corporate if i could transfer to the new franchise that had opened in my parent’s city because they had an opening for an aesthetician. the job listing was the exact same as the one i had applied for here in my current town. they interviewed me, told me what they had, etc. they said they’d get back to me a few days later, and when they did, they told me they couldnt give me the job. i asked why, considering i was already within the company and knew the protocols and training (which they loved because they realized they wouldnt have to pay to train me). they told me the newest center that was opening was indefinitely put on hold due to lack of funds, and they just didnt have a position open, but wanted to keep me on file when they did so i could immediately work for them. why even interview me then??\n\ni have had two aesthetic jobs in my city, and both were tremendous failures. i have a job lined up in the city im moving to that is MUCH more promising, and seems to be a much better fit for me. but please, for any esti who wants to break into the medical aesthetics field (which idk if i would consider that job medical aesthetics), please beware of this job. im happy to talk to anyone who wants to know the company name, but will not post publicly. \n\nall my love, esthie besties!!!\n",

    "text": "Hello fellow Estis.\n\nThis is a long post and I'm looking for advice. \n\nBackground: I graduated in 2021 and quickly got a job at a local destination spa doing basic facials and body treatments. I was the only esthetician there and basically got the spa back up and running, revamped the menu etc. \nI was making $14.50 an hour plus 35% commission and they automatically added 25% gratuity. I was making about $100 an hour give or take. Unfortunately, it wasn't busy enough so I set foot to find another part time job.\n\nIn Jan 2023 I landed as a laser technician performing laser tattoo removal, laser hair removal, facials and IPL at a local laser studio.  My pay since they paid for my laser training (sent me to Dallas for a few days) was $20 an hour and 5% commission on total revenue. It wasn't much but it was steadier than the destination spa and I was okay with it because I worked both places and was gaining experience. Eventually my goal was to leave the destination spa completely. \n\nIn Nov 2023 the laser studio decided to sell the LHR part pf the business to a local and very large Plastic Surgery Center, and I went with it. The tattoo removal was sold to another company. \n\nI tried to renegotiate my pay however the Plastic Surgery Center would not budge and said we could potentially revisit at a later date when they got to know me better. \n\nFast forward 6 months.. I have brought up this issue again. I'm having difficulty making ends meet (as I left the spa at the start of starting here because I would be working full time.)\n\nI currently offer Laser Hair removal,  dermaplaning,  Diamond glow, Co2 laser, got certified in Microneedling with prp, as well as many chemical peels including in depth.( I have accomplished a lot)\n\nThey have come back to me with this offer:\n\nTitrate my hourly pay over the next 3 months from $20 an hour to minimum wage which is $15 an hour where I am located. And bump my commission from 5% to 10%. \n\nAm I out of my mind for being a tad bit offended? \nIs this normal pay for an Esthetician that works in the medical field? \n\nMy cheapest service is a discounted LHR $117.50 which takes me about 10 min to perform if that. \n\nMy most expensive is $1900 for co2 laser that takes me about 1.5 hrs depending. \n\nPlease note that my books are not full and it obviously varies week to week. Also basically restarting some clientele for the 3rd time. \n\nI will also add that the other practitioners and I have become like family very quickly. It's not toxic here at all and I get free services should I choose. \n\nJust need some advice if I should stay where I'm at ( $20/5%), pursue the offer or try to renegotiate if they're willing. \n\n\nIf you've made it to the end, thank you so much. ❤️\n\n\n",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I was hoping I would find out more about how to get hired in a med spa or dermatology office (I know I need experience in a regular spa first but that is the goal.) Does anyone know of any additional courses like laser, microneedling, chemical peels, etc. that I could take to help me prepare for life in a med spa or that could help me get hired? Anytime I try to look things up for my state it’s not really clear on what the requirements are to work in these places if you aren’t a doctor or RN. Should I just go back to school or nursing? Or would medical assisting be helpful? I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I was hoping I would find out more about how to get hired in a med spa or dermatology office (I know I need experience in a regular spa first but that is the goal.) Does anyone know of any additional courses like laser, microneedling, chemical peels, etc. that I could take to help me prepare for life in a med spa or that could help me get hired? Anytime I try to look things up for my state it’s not really clear on what the requirements are to work in these places if you aren’t a doctor or RN. Should I just go back to school or nursing? Or would medical assisting be helpful? I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I was hoping I would find out more about how to get hired in a med spa or dermatology office (I know I need experience in a regular spa first but that is the goal.) Does anyone know of any additional courses like laser, microneedling, chemical peels, etc. that I could take to help me prepare for life in a med spa or that could help me get hired? Anytime I try to look things up for my state it’s not really clear on what the requirements are to work in these places if you aren’t a doctor or RN. Should I just go back to school or nursing? Or would medical assisting be helpful? I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I was hoping I would find out more about how to get hired in a med spa or dermatology office (I know I need experience in a regular spa first but that is the goal.) Does anyone know of any additional courses like laser, microneedling, chemical peels, etc. that I could take to help me prepare for life in a med spa or that could help me get hired? Anytime I try to look things up for my state it’s not really clear on what the requirements are to work in these places if you aren’t a doctor or RN. Should I just go back to school or nursing? Or would medical assisting be helpful? I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

I was hoping I would find out more about how to get hired in a med spa or dermatology office (I know I need experience in a regular spa first but that is the goal.) Does anyone know of any additional courses like laser, microneedling, chemical peels, etc. that I could take to help me prepare for life in a med spa or that could help me get hired? Anytime I try to look things up for my state it’s not really clear on what the requirements are to work in these places if you aren’t a doctor or RN. Should I just go back to school or nursing? Or would medical assisting be helpful? I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot.

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Hi all! I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions? Thanks in advance!! ",

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

    "text": "Hi all! I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions? Thanks in advance!! ",

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

I’m able to do the work but I just can’t keep up with my health. \n\nI’ve done medical aethetics and have a part time job in that, its just not busy enough for me to be there full time so I pick it up as I go about my month. \n\nI’m just getting so frustrated, I’ve been in this industry for almost 4 years now and all of these workplaces just treat their employees so badly or pay is too low or both. There are so many unorganized spas, nail bars, etc. out there.\n\nMy current spa job is very organized, they just don’t take care of their estheticians properly. I’m in Canada and I’m earning 1k per pay cheque working 5 days a week 7.5hrs. I get paid only hourly and receive 100% of my tips if clients tip and front desk doesn’t steal it. I’m 24F and I thought this was my dream job but I think it might be time for a career change.. \n",

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

I don’t necessarily want to be the one performing Botox, filler, things of that nature, but I would like to be in that kind of environment to observe and learn, so would going back to school to get that medical experience be a waste of time and money or my best option at working in a med spa or under a doctor?",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?

    "text": "Long story short, I started working at a medical spa a few months after I got my license. I was SO EXCITED, because this was my primary goal and I was achieving it so early in my esthetics career. I absolutely could not wait to learn EVERYTHING I could imaginable about the services and skin care lines that were carried at this medical spa. \n\nDuring my “training”, the “owner/lead esthetician” who was supposed to be training me and helping me do my practicals before I was on the books at her spa, was in another treatment room completely talking to another employee, I had to leave the practical(with an actual client) to get the owner to ask her for help and to make sure I was doing the service correctly. (Mind you - I was told to look up dermaplaning videos and YouTube videos OFF THE CLOCK prior to this under the assumption to watch them and figure out what I was doing from them, needless to say the “training” was an absolute joke and I’m glad I cared enough to learn as much as I could from multiple resources online when I wasn’t even working or getting paid)\n\nThere are countless situations and conversations I have had with the owner while I worked there where we seemed to just have rubbed one another the absolute wrong way. I once told her she made me feel as if I was “lower class” because at the time I was the only employee there (out of 4) that wasn’t being included in activities and plans that she posted about doing(on the med spa instagram) with the other girls that worked there. \n\nFor a long time, she wouldn’t post about me on social media, almost as if I didn’t even work there. That ended up changing, but I was only working there 2 days a week, after a year there I ended up extending my hours on those 2 days a week because my books were completely full and I wanted to be able to get more clients in. \n\nThe owner/lead esthetician ended up changing my access in our online booking system, no longer allowing me to change the hours I worked or book appointments for anyone. She started taking clients off of my book to put them on her own(without their knowledge or consent of changing providers for treatments) because her books were not full, at all. \n\nAnywho, still boils my blood because I bent over backwards for this woman, her business, and made 10% commission on services that were anywhere from $200-500 - and know I was and am a damn good employee. \n\nAfter I got wrongfully fired(another long story about how she essentially set me up so she could say she had a reason to fire me) -one of my regulars reached out with this screenshot. The owner apparently sent this to EVERY SINGLE client I ever saw in the year and a half I worked there. \n\nWhat would you have done if this happened to you? ",

    "text": "I’ll try to make this short. \n\nI’m a 29 female, licensed since September 2022. Haven’t had luck in getting my foot through the door, until potentially now. I interviewed at a fairly new establishment that’s been open since 2020. They recently progressed to calling themselves a medical spa. I was very rusty with my skills but the manager liked me enough to say that should I still be interested in working with them Mid-March (manager is going on vacation) they are open to having me. I feel it’s a great opportunity considering for the longest time I’ve thought about doing skincare. I also considered being an aesthetics nurse but never thought I was smart enough for that. I’m now at a point in my life where I feel determined to go for my RN degree and having this opportunity to be mentored and grow in this small little spa seems too good to pass up. My main downfall is money. \n\nI’m in bad credit card debt. It’s so bad that I can’t even take out a consolidation loan at the moment since I’m paying down one already. I’m currently working two jobs, one as a caregiver and another as a private security guard. Both pay me weekly and most of my checks go to paying down bills. Working at this spa would mean I’d be starting off at $17-18 which is fine, but I am not one to expect I’ll be tipped well. I am also concerned with body ergonomics. I’ve never considered how strenuous it might be on my hands/wrist, or even my neck when working on clients. I was told to expect at least 5 clients in a day. I won’t mind doing this temporarily as I don’t plan on just being an esthetician forever, but I am concerned it’s too risky right now to take on a new job and lose the steady income to pay down my debt.",

I looked out a month ago and got myself a job at a salon that focuses on brows and eyelashes. they’re making me do reception for now and I’m about to start learning how to do their lash lifting to provide services. I took the job really quick because I was very desperate to be in the field, and now I’m just not sure.\n\nthe boss is a little condescending and it’s only been my official 3rd week so far - anytime i make one small mistake, i feel like im being scolded. i felt anxiety about even going in today because im scared to even make one wrong move. Idk if im being sensitive but i thought that they would cut me some slack since it’s my first job in the field. \n\ni recently networked with someone who manages a medical spa and landed an interview. she said i would be a “medical esthetician” which i know is not technically a REAL thing but essentially i would be preforming facials and would need to take extra courses to learn how to draw blood, etc. \n\ni guess my question to all of you is what would you do if you were me? honestly the salon i work at right now I don’t see myself staying long term. I know my passion lies within doing facials and actual hands on skin contact, but i do love the idea of doing brows and lashes. im just not sure if its the right fit for me but i dont want to exactly give up so fast. \n\nmy other question is - are there any medical estheticians here? what’s your experience like and would you recommend working at a medspa? \n\nthank you in advance and sorry if this post seems a little rushed, my thoughts are all over the place lol ",

    "text": "Hello All, I am hoping to get some feedback on the state of my career. Before I even start, let me preface by saying I've heard all the things - \"if you truly want it then nothing can stop you\"...\"market yourself\"...\"show people what makes you unique\" etc etc. I've put everything into this career. My entire heart and soul. I've encountered many obstacles along the way. I have pressed on through many setbacks. For seven years I have not given up. I am not writing this to cast blame on anyone, not me nor my employers over the years. I am just humbly asking for advice and some objectivity. \n\nFull disclosure, I am in nursing school right now. I am wanting to open some new doors for myself, whether that puts me into the world of medical esthetics or traditional nursing, I am not sure. But in the meantime, here is my predicament:\n\nAbout two weeks ago I began my \"dream\" role at a plastic surgeon's office. I left behind a cushy (yet stagnant) job at a spa where I was making a good living, albeit in a toxic environment. At first I was swept away by the positive energy, the beautiful treatment room, and promises of finally getting to work with lasers and microneedling (you need physician oversight in my state to do these things). Two weeks in, I am realizing they were counting on me poaching clients from my old job to fill my books (I have a non-solicitation agreement that would put me in legal trouble if I violated, which I informed them about). Even if I did want to risk being sued, I have no way to contact my old clientele. Additionally, the place has been very sluggish with providing me supplies I need, I have ended up bringing in my own supplies and doing my best. And most of the time, I my books have been empty. The place seems very disorganized and I was just informed laser training has been pushed off indefinitely, and I feel somewhat deceived. Their social media is run by some outside company and it's...not good. It's not a good social media presence and they have advertised me very minimally. When I was hired, I was told I would be very busy but so far, none of their established clientele is really booking with me. I am on commission and I know it takes time to rebuild my books, but I don't have time. I'm an adult with adult bills and my focus is on school, not spending all day trying to market myself all over again. I am thinking about bartending instead while I am in school and just saying fuck it to esthetics for the time being. Maybe forever after everything this career has put me through. \n\nI guess this is sort of a venting session too, but after spending 8 hours in the building today feeling like a fool, and nothing on the books tomorrow, I just want to cry. \n\nSo, compassionate insight welcome. Tell me to go be a bartender and set me free. \n",

I have a few questions for you. \n\nI am currently considering taking a part time job at a medical spa where they provide all supplies, they have a central booking software, they provide all backbar, etc. They would be classifying me as 1099 (which I believe is misclassification, but not the ultimate issue I’m having.) \n\nThe things I’m concerned about are liability and malpractice insurance. The medspa is owned by two NPs and in the state I’m in, I can perform lasers/laser hair removal under a MD/DO, PA, or NP’s license/supervision. However, they are reluctant to add me under their insurance due to the cost and are requesting I get a quote to have my own independent insurance. I’m concerned because if something were to go wrong during a treatment, I’m worried that my license would be in jeopardy because 1-I’m not an employee under 1099 and 2-I’m not covered under their insurance policy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts/suggestions?
